Mathematical Theory

- Continuous function
- Intermediate Value Problem
- Convergence of a sequence



Fixed point

- Easy to implement
- absolute value of derivative should be less than 1

Bisection 

- Guarantees that the root always exists if the initial condition is satisfied

Newton method 

- Faster than bisection
- Need derivative (and second derivative)
- can fail to converge

Brent

- Faster than bisection
- Guarantees that the root always exists if the initial condition is satisfied
